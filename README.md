Hey Guys, today I created a program for a Arduino for a simple memory game. 

Here is what you need to have:

Red LED

Green LED

Blue LED

Yellow LED

4 Regular Buttons

A bunch of wires

An Arduino UNO

A programming cable

A computer to program

Here is the hookup:

Buttons:

buttonRed = 2;

buttonGreen = 3;

buttonBlue = 4;

buttonYellow = 5;

LED:

ledRed = 6;

ledGreen = 7;

ledBlue = 8;

ledYellow = 9;

Make sure you have ground for both button and each LED.

Don't worry about adding resistors, because all four LED's in the wiring are enough.
